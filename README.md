# Northwind-Main
This repository simply stores the core of the NetBeans Platform, branded for Northwind. We will also be able to make the Wiki available to end users for assistance, as well as the Issues page, though the issues will not be fixed here, but in the specific module's private repository. For the most part, this repo is just a place-holder for the entirety of the Northwind Project.

## Attention Contributors!
This Project, as well as its related Projects, is being developed using Java and the NetBeans Platform. In order to keep everyone on the same page:
- Java: Version 12 or higher is a must
- NetBeans: Version 11.1 or higher is a must

If everyone cooperates and uses the minimums listed above, we believe that everything should work on everyone else's systems with no major issues.

Thank you for choosing to contribute to the Northwind Project. Have fun! And, happy coding...

- The PekinSOFT Systems Team
