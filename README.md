# Northwind-Main
This repository simply stores the core of the NetBeans Platform, branded for Northwind. We will also be able to make the Wiki available to end users for assistance, as well as the Issues page, though the issues will not be fixed here, but in the specific module's private repository. For the most part, this repo is just a place-holder for the entirety of the Northwind Project.

## Attention Contributors!
Please, [start here](https://github.com/PekinSOFT-Systems/Northwind-Main/wiki/Contributors-Information) before reading on...

If you are contributing on the Northwind Project by creating a module or plugin, please fork this repo to use as your test run platform, as this repo contains all of the branding for Northwind, including changing the names of the end-user configuration files and locations. To test your modules or plugins in the Northwind application:

- First, test them in the development IDE.
- Second, build the NBM file.
- Third, run the Northwind application:
   - click on the Tools menu.
   - click on the Plugins menu item.
   - click on the Downloaded tab.
   - click on the Add Plugins... button.
      - navigate to where you stored the NBM file you created (most likely, in your project's `dist` folder) and select it.
   - click on the Install button toward the bottom-left of the dialog.
- Fourth, test your new module's functionality within the confines of Northwind.

If you do not want to clone this repository and run it from your NetBeans IDE installation, you can simply download the appropriate installer from the releases section and install it on your system.

This Project, as well as its related Projects, is being developed using Java and the NetBeans Platform. In order to keep everyone on the same page:
- Java: Version 12 or higher is a must
- NetBeans: Version 11.1 or higher is a must

If everyone cooperates and uses the minimums listed above, we believe that everything should work on everyone else's systems with no major issues.

Thank you for choosing to contribute to the Northwind Project. Have fun! And, happy coding...

- The PekinSOFT Systems Team
