# Northwind-Main
This repository simply stores the core of the NetBeans Platform, branded for Northwind. We will also be able to make the Wiki available to end users for assistance, as well as the Issues page, though the issues will not be fixed here, but in the specific module's private repository. For the most part, this repo is just a place-holder for the entirety of the Northwind Project.

## Attention Contributors!
If you are contributing on the Northwind Project by creating a module or plugin, please fork this repo to use as your development platform, as this repo contains all of the branding for Northwind, including changing the names of the end-user configuration files and locations. To change which platform you are building your module or plugin against, right-click your top-level module project node and choose Properties from the bottom of the pop-up menu. In the Project Properties editor, click on the Libraries section. You can then change which platform you are developing against either:

- In the dropdown list next to the label NetBeans Platform, ***or***
- Click the Manage Platforms... button and add the platform from this repository to your NetBeans Platform Manager.

Thank you for your desire to contribute modules and plugins that will make up the tools suite for Northwind!
