MSG_AfterRestartReportQuestion=There was an error during the last run of Northwind.\nCan you please report the problem?
MSG_SCAN_CANCELLED2=<html>It is not possible to interrupt the scanning process.<br>If you are encountering a problem related to the scanning process and would like to send us your<br>log file click Send Report. <p><p>In case the slowness appears repeatedly, you may <b>enable internal profiling</b> for further reports<br>by clicking Send Report and Enable Profiling. Profiling will be enabled for <b>this Northwind run only</b> and<br>will be disabled again once the Northwind is restarted. By providing profiling data, you significantly<br>enhance the chances the real problem is identified and solved. <p><p>Profiling is off by default, because it might slow the Northwind operations. To enable it permanently,<br>add "-J-Dorg.netbeans.modules.parsing.impl.indexing.RepositoryUpdater.indexerSampling=enable"<br>option to the etc/netbeans.conf file in your Northwind installation.
